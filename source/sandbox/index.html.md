# Introduction

Welcome to the Code42 Developer Portal! Here, you can find many resources to assist you in automating and scripting against Code42. Be sure to check out the complete [API Documentation]()
to get an idea for all of the programmatic functionality available and learn about the API's general usage.

You might also be interested in using [py42](), (the Code42 Python library), or the [Code42 CLI](), depending on your automation use case.
