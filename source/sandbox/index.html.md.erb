# Code42 Developer Portal

Welcome to the Code42 Developer Portal! Here you will find resources to assist you in leveraging
the Code42 API for automation and scripting. The Code42 APIs are a powerful set of tools you can use
for everything from performing automated actions to integrating Code42 with your company's security applications.

Code42 also offers a [Python SDK](https://py42docs.code42.com) and [Command Line Interface](https://clidocs.code42.com) that you may also find useful for automating tasks.
Be sure to explore the documentation for these tools in addition to the complete API documentation before deciding what
tools are right for your use case.
