# Code42 Developer Portal

Welcome to the Code42 Developer Portal! Here you will find resources to assist you in leveraging
the Code42 API for automation and scripting. The Code42 APIs are a powerful set of tools you can use
for everything from performing automated actions to integrating Code42 with your company's security applications.

Code42 also offers a [Python SDK](https://py42docs.code42.com) and [Command Line Interface](https://clidocs.code42.com) that you may also find useful for automating tasks.

## Code42 command-line interface (CLI)

The Code42 CLI is the go-to tool for the most common Code42 automation tasks. It is designed to make it easy to quickly
execute bulk tasks that would be tedious in the Code42 console (for example, adding 1,000 new users to the High Risk Employee
list or to a Legal Hold matter). It allows you to easily integrate, archive, or simply explore the data available in Code42
in ways the Code42 console doesn't allow. The CLI is an open-source Python project, installable via pip. Our team is open to
feedback, feature requests, bug reports, and contributions on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/code42/code42cli).

## py42

If your automation needs are a bit more specific than the CLI can handle, and you're familiar with Python, then py42 is for
you. Py42 is a user-friendly interface to all things Code42, supplying an API that is more low-level than the CLI, but works
hard to abstract away the more tedious parts of working with the Code42 API directly. To make your experience automating
Code42 workflows as hassle-free as possible, py42 provides session and auth-token management, automatic resolution of
microservice and storage node host addresses, helper methods to handle pagination, and informative custom exceptions. You
shouldn't have to be a Code42 product expert to be able to get the most out of the data Code42 provides, and py42 makes
that a reality. Py42 is also open-source, and weâ€™re open to suggestions and feedback on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/code42/py42).

## Code42 API

If automating in Python is not an option, our API can be used directly with whatever tooling or language you have. The
Developer Portal is the central place for our API reference documentation, providing a single location to get the schema
for all of our endpoints, regardless of where they live in the cloud. And our API gateway is quickly expanding to encompass
all of our endpoints as well, so eventually you'll have a single place to interact with all things Code42 API.
