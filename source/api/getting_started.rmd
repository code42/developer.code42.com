# Getting started

## Request URLs

The domain used for making API requests can be determined using the domain you use to log in to the Code42 console. All API requests should be made using https.

| Console Domain | API Domain |
| ---------------| -----------|
| crashplan.com  | api.prod.ffs.us2.code42.com |
| console.us.code42.com  | api.us.code42.com |
| console.ie.code42.com  | api.ie.code42.com |

## Authentication

Most API calls require an [authentication token](https://support.code42.com/Administrator/Cloud/Monitoring_and_managing/Code42_API_resources/Code42_API_authentication_methods#Use_token_authentication) in the header of the request. To obtain an authentication token, use your Code42 administrator credentials to submit a `GET` request to the `/v1/auth/` API. (For details, see the [Auth API documentation](/api/#tag/Auth).)

In the following example, replace `<Code42Username>` with a Code42 administrator username, and replace `<RequestURL>` with the [request URL](#request-urls) of your Code42 cloud instance:

```bash
curl -X GET -u "<Code42Username>" -H "Accept: application/json" <RequestURL>/v1/auth/
```

If your organization uses [two-factor authentication for local users](https://support.code42.com/Administrator/Cloud/Configuring/Two-factor_authentication_for_local_users), you must also include a `totp-auth` header value containing the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) supplied by the Google Authenticator mobile app. The example below includes a TOTP value of 424242.

```bash
curl -X GET -u "<Code42Username>" -H "totp-auth: 424242" -H "Accept: application/json" <RequestURL>/v1/auth/
```

A successful request returns an authentication token. For example:

```bash
{"bearerToken": "eyJjdHkiO_bxYJOOn28y...5HGtGHgJzHVCE8zfy1qRBf_rhchA"}
```

### Token considerations

* Authentication tokens expire after 30 minutes.
* The user account making the authentication API request must have the [Customer Cloud Admin](https://support.code42.com/Administrator/Cloud/Monitoring_and_managing/Roles_reference#Customer_Cloud_Admin) role.

## Get a tenant ID

Some APIs require that you provide the unique ID of your organization (or tenant) in the Code42 cloud. To obtain the tenant ID, use your Code42 administrator credentials to submit a `GET` request to the [`/v1/customer` API](/api/#tag/Customer).

In the following example, replace `<AuthToken>` with the [authentication token](#authentication) and replace `<RequestURL>` with the [request URL](#request-urls) of your Code42 cloud instance:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" <RequestURL>/v1/customer
```

A successful response returns the tenantId:

```json
{
{
    "name": "Example customer",
    "registrationKey": "8u42pwskc42p42hmrj",
    "tenantId": "c4b5e830-4242-4242-4242-345664cfbb33"
}
```
