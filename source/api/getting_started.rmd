# Getting started

## Request URLs

The domain used for making API requests can be determined using the domain you use to log in to the Code42 console. All API requests should be made using https.

| Console Domain            | API Domain         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| console.us.code42.com     | api.us.code42.com  |
| console.us2.crashplan.com | api.us2.code42.com |
| console.ie.code42.com     | api.ie.code42.com  |
| console.gov.code42.com    | api.gov.code42.com |

## Authentication

API calls require an authentication token in the header of the request. To obtain an authentication token, [create an API client](https://support.code42.com/Administrator/Cloud/Code42_console_reference/API_clients) and then submit its ID and secret in a request to the /v1/oauth API. 

In the following example (using curl), replace `<ClientID>` with the API client ID, replace `<Secret>` with the API client secret, and replace `<RequestURL>` with the [request URL](#section/Getting-started/Request-URLs) of your Code42 cloud instance (also known as the base URL):

```bash
curl -X POST -u '<ClientID>:<Secret>' -d "" https://<RequestURL>/v1/oauth
```

For example:

```bash
curl -X POST -u 'key-79muGw9i424:DWL-mPQ' -d "" https://api.us.code42.com/v1/oauth
```

A successful request returns an authentication token. For example:

```bash
{"access_token":"eyJjdHkiO_bxYJOOn28y...5HGtGHgJzHVCE8zfy1qRBf_rhchA","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":900}
```

Use the authentication token (also known as a bearer token) in all your API requests. For example, following is an API request to get a list of users:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.us.code42.com/v1/users?active=true&blocked=false&pageSize=100' \
-H "authorization: Bearer eyJjdHkiO_bxYJOOn28y...5HGtGHgJzHVCE8zfy1qRBf_rhchA" 
```

### Token considerations

* Authentication tokens expire after 15 minutes.
* Authentication tokens provide the API permissions defined in the API client. 


Other authentication methods: While [API clients](#tag/Auth/paths/~1v1~1oauth/post) are the preferred method for authentication, these other authentication methods are still supported:


**Basic authentication:**

```bash
curl -u "<username>:<password>" https://<RequestURL>/<Resource>
```

**Basic authentication to obtain a User authentication token:**

```bash
curl -X GET -u "<username>:<password>" https://<RequestURL>/v1/auth
```

**Basic authentication to obtain a User authentication token when a second factor (TOTP) token is required:**

```bash
curl -X -H "totp-auth: <totp_token" GET -u "<username>:<password>" https://<RequestURL>/v1/auth 
```

## Get a tenant ID

Some APIs require that you provide the unique ID of your organization (or tenant) in the Code42 cloud. To obtain the tenant ID, use your Code42 administrator credentials to submit a `GET` request to the [`/v1/customer` API](/api/#tag/Customer).

In the following example, replace `<AuthToken>` with the [authentication token](#authentication) and replace `<RequestURL>` with the [request URL](/api/#section/Getting-started/Request-URLs) of your Code42 cloud instance:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" https://<RequestURL>/v1/customer
```

A successful response returns the tenantId:

```json
{
    "name": "Example customer",
    "registrationKey": "8u42pwskc42p42hmrj",
    "tenantId": "c4b5e830-4242-4242-4242-345664cfbb33"
}
```
