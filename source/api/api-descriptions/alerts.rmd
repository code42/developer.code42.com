Alerts are notifications that are produced when user file activity matches one or more alert rules. To create alert rules using the API, see the [Rules APIs](/api#tag/Rules). When an alert is triggered, it appears on the View Alerts screen in the Code42 console, and if configured, an email is sent to an administrator. 

For more information about alerts, see our [support article](https://support.code42.com/Incydr/Admin/Monitoring_and_managing/View_and_manage_alert_notifications).
