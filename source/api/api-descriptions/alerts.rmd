Alerts are notifications that are produced when user file activity matches one or more alert rules. To create alert rules using the API, see the [Rules APIs](/api#tag/Rules).

When an alert is triggered, it appears on the [Alerts > Review Alerts](https://support.code42.com/Administrator/Cloud/Code42_console_reference/Alerts_reference#Review_Alerts) screen in the Code42 console, and if configured, an email is sent to an administrator.

For more information about the Rules and Alerts APIs, see our [Security alerts API](/security-alerts-api/#security-alerts-api) guide.
