Detection Lists allow you to place users into categories that make it possible to more closely monitor the file activity and manage the alerts of a particular group of users.

Incydr currently offers two types of detection lists:

- High Risk Employees list: A list of users whose actions or role in the company places them at a higher risk of compromising company data.
- Departing Employees list: A list of users that the company knows are due to leave the company, either voluntarily (for example, seeking other employment, retirement) or involuntarily (for example, termination).

Before a user can be added to a detection list, you must create a profile for the user with the [Create a detection lists profile](/api/#operation/UserControllerV2_Create) API (resource `/v1/detection-lists/user/create`).

This profile includes information about the user specifically for use in both lists, such as notes about the employeeâ€™s departure or why they are high risk, risk factors, and cloud user names.

Users that are in a detection list are also automatically associated with default [alert rules](/api/#tag/Rules) that apply to those lists.

For more information on the detection list APIs, see our [Detection List Management API](/detection-list-management-api/#detection-list-management-api) guide.
