**The `/v1/detection-lists` endpoints have been deprecated.**

Detection Lists are now [Watchlists](https://support.code42.com/Incydr/Admin/Monitoring_and_managing/Manage_watchlists).

Functionality for adding users to Departing Employee and High Risk Employee categories has been migrated to the [Watchlists API](/api#tag/Watchlists).

Functionality for listing and managing User Risk Profiles (e.g. adding Cloud Aliases and Notes to a user) has been migrated to the [User Risk Profile API](/api#tag/User-Risk-Profiles).
