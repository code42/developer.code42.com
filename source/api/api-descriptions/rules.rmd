Rules define criteria for what types of file activity should result in alerts, and who will be alerted when important data may be leaving your company. To work with the alerts generated by rules, see the [Alerts APIs](/api#tag/Alerts).

You can use these APIs to:

* Get a list of all rules
* Get details on rules
* Get users assigned to a rule
* Add and remove users and their aliases on a rule
* Enable or disable a set of rules

For more information about rules, see our [support article](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827730038935).
