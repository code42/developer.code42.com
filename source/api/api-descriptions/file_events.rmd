File events represent the creation, modification, deletion, and movement of files in your organization's working environment (both on endpoints and in supported cloud providers).

When file activity occurs on an endpoint or in the cloud, Incydr records metadata about the event and retains it for 90 days. At any time in that 90-day window you can search for the file activity based on the metadata collected, such as (but not limited to):

- the file name
- who acted on the file
- whether the file was shared in a cloud service or email
- the device the file was stored on

For a description of all information recorded in file event details, see our [support article](https://support.code42.com/Administrator/Cloud/Code42_console_reference/Forensic_Search_reference_guide#File_event_details).
