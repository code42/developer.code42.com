HTTP PATCH methods support partially updating a resource. To accomplish this, each request must specify exactly which
fields are to be updated. This is commonly called the "field mask", and in this endpoint is provided by the `paths` query
param. Any keys in the request body that aren't in the field mask paths are ignored. This enables one to request an
object via a GET request, change the desired fields, then send back the same full object, without the possibility of
overwriting some other request that had happened in the meantime that had modified a different, unrelated field.

For example:

To update the `notes` and `endDate` fields for a user risk profile, make a `PATCH` request to
`/v1/user-risk-profiles/{user_id}?paths=notes,endDate` with a request body of:

```json
{
  "notes": "note_update",
  "endDate": {
    "year": 2023,
    "month": 3,
    "day": 18
  }
}
```
