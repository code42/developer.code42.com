Employees whose roles, behaviors, and access increase risk to the company can be monitored more closely for concerning file activity with watchlists. Protect data by monitoring high-risk employees such as those who:

* Are about to leave the company or have just joined the company and may not be aware of your security practices.
* Have privileged system access or access to intellectual property and other confidential data.
* Seem dissatisfied with their jobs (for example, were turned down for a promotion or have teammate conflicts) or have raised concerns about their performance (from a negative review, demotion, or a performance improvement plan).
* Work remotely, travel frequently and work on a variety of networks, or are temporary contractors.
* Have poor security awareness as shown by consistently falling for phishing tests, failing security training, or using unsanctioned tools in their jobs.
