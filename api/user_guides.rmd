# User Guides

Review the user guides to learn how to perform tasks using the Code42 APIs. 


## Release notes

For release notes, see the [Code42 API release notes](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827738522007).

## Get started

### Licensing

To use all the APIs you must have [full API access](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827740809239).

### Request URLs

The domain used for making API requests can be determined using the domain you use to log in to the Code42 console. All API requests should be made using https.

| Console Domain         | API Domain         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| console.us.code42.com  | api.us.code42.com  |
| console.us2.code42.com | api.us2.code42.com |
| console.ie.code42.com  | api.ie.code42.com  |
| console.gov.code42.com | api.gov.code42.com |

### Authentication

API calls require an authentication token in the header of the request. To obtain an authentication token, [create an API client](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827617150231) and then submit its ID and secret in a request to the /v1/oauth API.
The /v1/oauth API supports the OAuth client credentials grant type as described in RFC 6749. It is recommended to use HTTP basic auth header to pass in the client credentials, but the request body is also supported for OAuth clients that do not support basic auth.

In the following examples (using curl), replace `<ClientID>` with the API client ID, replace `<Secret>` with the API client secret, and replace `<RequestURL>` with the [request URL](#request-urls) of your Code42 cloud instance (also known as the base URL).

Using HTTP basic auth:

```bash
curl -X POST -u '<ClientID>:<Secret>' -d "" 'https://<RequestURL>/v1/oauth?grant_type=client_credentials'
```

For example:

```bash
curl -X POST -u 'key-79muGw9i424:DWL-mPQ' -d "" 'https://api.us.code42.com/v1/oauth?grant_type=client_credentials'
```

Using the request body:

```bash
curl -X POST  https://<RequestURL>/v1/oauth \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<ClientID>&client_secret=<Secret>'
```

For example:

```bash
curl -X POST  https://api.us.code42.com/v1/oauth \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=key-79muGw9i424&client_secret=DWL-mPQ'
```

A successful request returns an authentication token. For example:

```bash
{"access_token":"eyJjdHkiO_bxYJOOn28y...5HGtGHgJzHVCE8zfy1qRBf_rhchA","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":900}
```

Use the authentication token (also known as a bearer token) in all your API requests. For example, following is an API request to get a list of users:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.us.code42.com/v1/users \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer eyJjdHkiO_bxYJOOn28y...5HGtGHgJzHVCE8zfy1qRBf_rhchA" \
-d '{"active": true, "blocked": false,"username":[],"page":0,"pageSize":100}'
```

### Token considerations

* Authentication tokens expire after 15 minutes.
* Authentication tokens provide the API permissions defined in the API client.


[API clients](#tag/Auth/paths/~1v1~1oauth/post) are the preferred method for authentication. Basic authentication methods are deprecated:


**Basic authentication:**

```bash
curl -u "<username>:<password>" https://<RequestURL>/<Resource>
```

**Basic authentication to obtain a User authentication token:**

```bash
curl -X GET -u "<username>:<password>" https://<RequestURL>/v1/auth
```

**Basic authentication to obtain a User authentication token when a second factor (TOTP) token is required:**

```bash
curl -X -H "totp-auth: <totp_token" GET -u "<username>:<password>" https://<RequestURL>/v1/auth
```

### Get a tenant ID

Some APIs require that you provide the unique ID of your organization (or tenant) in the Code42 cloud. To obtain the tenant ID, use your Code42 administrator credentials to submit a `GET` request to the [`/v1/customer` API](/api/#tag/Customer).

In the following example, replace `<AuthToken>` with the [authentication token](#authentication) and replace `<RequestURL>` with the [request URL](#request-urls) of your Code42 cloud instance:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" https://<RequestURL>/v1/customer
```

A successful response returns the tenantId:

```json
{
    "name": "Example customer",
    "registrationKey": "8u42pwskc42p42hmrj",
    "tenantId": "c4b5e830-4242-4242-4242-345664cfbb33"
}
```

### Request variables

In the examples in the user guides:

* Replace `<RequestURL>` with the [request URL](#request-urls) of your Code42 cloud instance.
* Replace `<AuthToken>` with the [authentication token](#authentication).
* Replace `<SampleTenant>` with the [tenant ID](#get-a-tenant-id).


### Troubleshooting and support
If you experience issues, contact [Code42 support](https://support.code42.com/), or contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to engage the Code42 Professional Services team.

## Manage alerts

### Manage alert notifications

To work with alert notifications, use the API query commands to search for alert notifications. Once you [identify specific alert IDs](#locate-alert-rule-ids), you can then add a note, dismiss, or reopen those alert notifications.

#### Search for alert notifications by alert filter criteria

To search for alert notifications using filter criteria and identify alert IDs, use the [/v1/alerts/query-alerts](/api#operation/Alerts_QueryAlert) API command.

```bash
curl -X POST "<RequestURL>/v1/alerts/query-alerts" \
-H "accept: text/plain" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "tenantId": "<SampleTenant>", "groups": [ { "filters": [ { "term": "<FilterType>", "operator": "<OperatorValue>", "value": "<Criteria>" } ], "filterClause": "AND" } ], "groupClause": "OR", "pgSize": "20", "pgNum": "0", "srtKey": "CreatedAt", "srtDirection": "DESC" }'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<FilterType>` with the filter, `<OperatorValue>` with the operator option, and `<Criteria>` with the search term to use in the search. See [Filter syntax for the query-alerts API command](#filter-syntax-for-the-query-alerts-api-command) below for details.

A successful response returns basic information about the alert notifications that match your search criteria, including the alert IDs of those notifications (look for the `"id":"value"` entry):

```json
{
  "type$": "ALERT_QUERY_RESPONSE",
  "alerts": [
    {
      "type$": "ALERT_SUMMARY",
      "tenantId": "123456",
      "type": "FED_ENDPOINT_EXFILTRATION",
      "name": "Departing employee endpoint exfiltration system rule",
      "description": "System rule for departing employee endpoint exfiltration.",
      "actor": "burt.morales@example.com",
      "target": "N/A",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "ruleId": "123456789424242",
      "ruleSource": "Departing Employee",
      "id": "987654321424242",
      "createdAt": "2020-04-03T15:21:44.6139300Z",
      "state": "OPEN"
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 1,
  "problems": []
}
```

#### Search for multiple alert notifications by alert IDs

After you've located the alert IDs for specific alerts, use the [/v1/alerts/query-details](/api#operation/Alerts_QueryAlertDetails) API command to search those IDs and view more details about those alert notifications.

```bash
curl -X POST "<RequestURL>/v1/alerts/query-details" \
-H "accept: text/plain" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "alertIds": [ "<SampleAlertID1>", "<SampleAlertID2>" ]}'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<SampleAlertID1>` and `<SampleAlertID2>` with the IDs of the alert notifications. Enclose each ID in quotation marks and separate them with commas.

A successful response returns full details about the alert notifications, including a list of files involved in the activity.

```bash
{
  "type$": "ALERT_DETAILS_RESPONSE",
  "alerts": [
    {
      "type$": "ALERT_DETAILS",
      "tenantId": "123456",
      "type": "FED_ENDPOINT_EXFILTRATION",
      "name": "Departing employee endpoint exfiltration system rule",
      "description": "System rule for departing employee endpoint exfiltration.",
      "actor": "burt.morales@example.com",
      "target": "N/A",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "ruleId": "123456789424242",
      "ruleSource": "Departing Employee",
      "id": "987654321424242",
      "createdAt": "2020-04-08T13:50:25.3644410Z",
      "state": "OPEN",
      "observations": [
        {
          "type$": "OBSERVATION",
          "id": "112233445566",
          "observedAt": "2020-04-08T13:40:00.0000000Z",
          "type": "FedEndpointExfiltration",
          "data": "{\"type$\":\"OBSERVED_ENDPOINT_ACTIVITY\",\"id\":\"665544332211\",\"sources\":[\"Endpoint\"],\"exposureTypes\":[\"ApplicationRead\",\"CloudStorage\"],\"firstActivityAt\":\"2020-04-08T13:40:00.0000000Z\",\"lastActivityAt\":\"2020-04-08T13:45:00.0000000Z\",\"fileCount\":2,\"totalFileSize\":311096,\"fileCategories\":[{\"type$\":\"OBSERVED_FILE_CATEGORY\",\"category\":\"Image\",\"fileCount\":2,\"totalFileSize\":311096,\"isSignificant\":false}],\"files\":[{\"type$\":\"OBSERVED_FILE\",\"eventId\":\"998877665544\",\"path\":\"C:/Users/burt.morales/\",\"name\":\"1586353274_family_photo.png\",\"category\":\"Image\"},{\"type$\":\"OBSERVED_FILE\",\"eventId\":\"334455667788\",\"path\":\"C:/Users/burt.morales/Dropbox/\",\"name\":\"1586353274_family_photo.png\",\"category\":\"Image\"}],\"syncToServices\":[\"Dropbox\"],\"sendingIpAddresses\":[\"192.0.2.0\"]}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


#### Add a note to an alert notification

To add a note to an alert notification, first locate its alert ID using one of the queries above. Then use the [/v1/alerts/add-note](/api#operation/Alerts_AddNoteToAlert) API command to add a note to that alert. Be aware that any note you add overwrites any existing note attached to the alert.

```bash
curl -X POST "<RequestURL>/v1/alerts/add-note" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "tenantId": "<SampleTenant>", "alertId": "<SampleAlertID>", "note": "This is an example note." }'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<SampleAlertID>` with the alert ID.

#### Dismiss alert notifications

You can dismiss multiple alert notifications at once using the API. To dismiss alert notifications, first locate the alert IDs using one of the queries above. Then use the [/v1/alerts/update-state](/api#operation/Alerts_UpdateAlertState) API command with a `state` value of `RESOLVED` to dismiss those alerts.

```bash
curl -X POST "<RequestURL>/v1/alerts/update-state" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "tenantId": "<SampleTenant>", "alertIds": [ "<SampleAlertID1>", "<SampleAlertID2>" ], "state": "RESOLVED", "note": "This is an example note."}'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<SampleAlertID1>` and `<SampleAlertID2>` with the IDs of the alert notifications. Enclose each ID in quotation marks and separate them with commas.

Be aware that any note you enter overwrites any existing note attached to the alert. If you want to dismiss the alert without adding a note (or want to preserve existing notes), delete the "note" term and sample text from the command.

#### Reopen dismissed alert notifications

You can reopen multiple dismissed alert notifications at once using the API. To reopen alert notifications, first locate the alert IDs using one of the queries above. Then use the [/v1/alerts/update-state](/api#operation/Alerts_UpdateAlertState) API command with the OPEN state value to reopen those alerts.

```bash
curl -X POST "<RequestURL>/v1/alerts/update-state" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "tenantId": "<SampleTenant>", "alertIds": [ "<SampleAlertID1>", "<SampleAlertID2>" ], "state": "OPEN", "note": "This is an example note."}'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<SampleAlertID1>` and `<SampleAlertID2>` with the IDs of the alert notifications. Enclose each ID in quotation marks and separate them with commas.

Be aware that any note you enter overwrites any existing note attached to the alert. If you want to reopen the alert without adding a note (or want to preserve existing notes), delete the "note" term and sample text from the command.

#### Filter syntax for the query alerts API command

The [/v1/alerts/query-alerts](/api#operation/Alerts_QueryAlert) API uses these filter types, operators, and criteria values to search for alert notifications.

Filter Type | Operator | Criteria
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
CreatedAt | ON, ON_OR_AFTER, ON_OR_BEFORE | Date the alert was triggered, in yyyy-MM-dd format
Actor | IS, IS_NOT, CONTAINS, DOES_NOT_CONTAIN | The username or cloud alias (actor) of the person who caused the event, or portions thereof
Severity | IS, IS_NOT | HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
Name | IS, IS_NOT, CONTAINS, DOES_NOT_CONTAIN | The name of the rule, or portions thereof
Description | IS, IS_NOT, CONTAINS, DOES_NOT_CONTAIN | The description of the rule, or portions thereof
State | IS, IS_NOT | OPEN or DISMISSED
AlertID | IS | The ID of a specific alert notification



### Manage alert rule user lists

If a rule either applies only to specific users or applies to all users except specific users, you can manage the users in those inclusion or exclusion lists using the API. As with alert notifications, you'll need to identify the rule ID associated with the rule before you can manage the users to which it applies.

#### Locate alert rule IDs

Before you can manage the users associated with an alert rule, you need to view details about alert rules and identify the rule IDs for which you want to manage users. Use the [GET /v2/alert-rules](/api#operation/Rules_GetRules) API command to locate alert rule IDs.

**Note:** The API commands for alert notification searches described above also include the ID of the rule that generated the alert. Look for the "ruleID": `"<value>"` entry in the details returned by the query.

```bash
curl -X GET "<RequestURL>/v2/alert-rules" \
-H "accept: text/plain" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"PageSize": "20", "PageNumber": "0"}'
```

A successful response returns basic information about the alert notifications that match your search criteria, including the rule IDs of those notifications (look for the `"id"` entry):

```json
    {
        "createdAt": "2021-04-27T02:11:07.4016710Z",
        "createdBy": "sean.cassidy@example.com",
        "modifiedAt": "2021-09-03T06:44:10.2802010Z",
        "modifiedBy": "jim.dandy@example.com",
        "isSystemRule": false,
        "id": "932281e9-4242-4ad0-b430-b4ea835c93b1",
        "name": "File Name Alert",
        "description": "",
        "isEnabled": true,
        "source": "Alerting",
        "notifications": {
            "isEnabled": false,
            "contacts": []
        },
```

#### View an alert rule's user list

Use the [GET /v2/alert-rules/{id}/users](/api#operation/Rules_GetUsers) API command to view a list of users that are either included in or excluded from a specific alert rule. The output from this command groups the user email addresses and cloud aliases in the rule's inclusion or exclusion list by the user ID associated with those details (which is generally the userUID value in Code42). You can then use this user ID to remove specific email addresses and cloud aliases from a rule's inclusion or exclusion list as needed.

```bash
curl -X GET "<RequestURL>/v2/alert-rules/<id>/users" \
-H "accept: text/plain" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

In the preceding example, replace `<id>` with the ID of the alert rule for which you want to view users.

A successful response lists the email addresses and cloud aliases of the users in the alert rule's inclusion or exclusion list, grouped by the user ID value (identified by the "userIdFromAuthority" label) associated with that information.

```json
{
    "id": "05bbf4e5-4242-47f9-b048-72c9a122de29",
    "users": [
        {
            "userIdFromAuthority": "Null UserIdFromAuthority.  These usernames must be edited in the web app.",
            "aliases": [
                "sean.cassidy@example.com",
                "jim.dandy@example"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "mode": 0
}

```

If a user ID was not provided when users were added to the alert rule (as is common when users are added using the Code42 command-line interface or manually with [Alerts in the Code42 console](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687892375)), the results note that the "userIdFromAuthority" value is null. To work with an alert rule's inclusion or exclusion list if the user ID value is null, use the [Alerts screens in the Code42 console](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687892375) to manually add and remove users. Alternately, you can use the [DELETE /v2/alert-rules/{id}/users](/api/#tag/Rules/operation/Rules_RemoveAllUsers) API command to remove all email addresses and aliases from a rule, and then re-add user information to that rule using the [POST /v2/alert-rules/{id}/users](/api/#tag/Rules/operation/Rules_AddUsers) using the users' userUID in Code42.


## Manage cases
Use the Case APIs to create and manage cases for security investigations. A case is used to record results of an investigation into suspicious file activity. For information about creating and managing cases in the Code42 console, see our [support article](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827658933527).

Typically, a security analyst will create a case based on an investigation that shows unauthorized file activity, and will add file events from Forensic Search to the case as evidence. The case can have additional file events added to it if needed, and can be routed in a CSV or PDF file as necessary for resolution. Although cases are specific to Code42, you can integrate cases into your SIEM, SOAR, or other incident management system. For integration resources, see our [support article](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687363351).

### Create a case

When you create a case, you include a name for the case and any other information needed, such as the actor ID of the person whom the case is about, the user UID of the person assigned to work on the case, a description of the case, and a summary of the findings. By default, when you create a case, its status is "open".

The following example demonstrates how to create a case with the [/v1/cases](/api#operation/createCaseUsingPOST) API.

```bash
curl -X POST <requestURL>/v1/cases \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>"" \
-d '{"assignee": "<userUID-of-assignee>", "description": "<description>", "findings": "<findings>", "name": "<name-of-case>", "subject": "<actorID-of-subject>" }'
```

In the preceding example:

* Replace `<userUID-of-assignee>` with the user UID of the person assigned to take the case.
* Replace `<actorID-of-subject>` with the actor ID of the person the case is about.

### Download case summary as a PDF

The PDF contains the case subject, details, and findings. Detailed file activity is not included. You can route the resulting PDF to interested parties, such as a security team, members of an insider risk working group, or company executives. Use the -o argument to specify a unique filename. The resulting file is saved in the directory from which you issue the request in the command line.

The following example demonstrates how to download a case summary with a PDF using the [/v1/cases/\<caseNumber\>/export](/api#operation/pdfExportUsingGET) API.

```bash
curl -X GET <requestURL>/v1/cases/<caseID>/export \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" -o <filename>.pdf
```

In the preceding example, replace `<caseID>` with the ID of the case.


### Export file events for a case as a CSV file

The comma-separated value (CSV) file contains the case subject, details, and findings, as well as the file events associated with the case. Use the -o argument to specify a unique filename. The resulting file is saved in the directory from which you issue the request in the command line.

You can integrate the resulting CSV file into your SOAR, SIEM, or other incident management system. For integration resources, see our [support article](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687363351). For field definitions of the file events shown in the CSV file, see our [support article](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827723634327).

The following example demonstrates how to export file events for a case as a CSV file using the [/v1/cases/\<caseNumber\>/fileevent/export](/api#operation/csvExportUsingGET) API.

```bash
curl -X GET <requestURL>/v1/cases/<caseID>/fileevent/export \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>' -o <filename>.csv
```

In the preceding example, replace `<caseID>` with the ID of the case.

### Get all cases for a tenant

You can get a paginated list of all cases in your company's instance in the Code42 cloud, also known as your "tenant". The returned information does not include the file event details. This API can be used for verification purposes, such as to check whether cases have been successfully added or successfully updated.

The following example demonstrates how to get all cases for a tenant using the [/v1/cases](/api#operation/getCasesUsingGET) API.

```bash
curl -X GET '<requestURL>/v1/cases' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>"
```


## Manage actors

The Actor APIs are useful to get an actor's basic information. Actors are the identities monitored by Incydr.

### Get an actor

You can get information on an individual actor that includes the name (usually an email address), and attributes about the actor like department and geography.

The following example demonstrates how to get information on a user with the [/v1/actors/actor/name/\<name\>/parent](/api/#tag/Actors/operation/getActorOrParentByName) API.

```bash
curl -X GET <requestURL>/v1/actors/actor/name/<name>/parent \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>"
```

In the preceding example, replace `<name>` with the with the actor’s full username/email.


## Manage users

The User APIs are useful to get a user's basic information, or to get a quick snapshot of users who are active, inactive, or blocked.

### Get a list of users

To get a list of specific users, in the username field enter the Code42 usernames in a comma-separated list. To return a list of all users, leave the username field empty. Among other details, the returned results include the user's UID, Code42 username, and organization the user belongs to.

The following example demonstrates how to get a list of users using the [/v1/users](/api/#tag/User/paths/~1v1~1users/get) API.

```bash
curl -X GET <requestURL>/v1/users \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-d '{"active": true, "blocked": false,"username":[],"page":0,"pageSize":100}'
```


### Get a user

You can get information on an individual user that includes the Code42 username, whether the user is active or blocked, and organization the user belongs to, among other things.

The following example demonstrates how to get information on a user with the [/v1/users/\<userId\>](/api/#tag/User/paths/~1v1~1users~1{userId}/get) API.

```bash
curl -X GET <requestURL>/v1/users/<userUID> \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>"
```

In the preceding example, replace `<userUID>` with the user's UID.


## Manage watchlists

### Add an actor to a watchlist

The following example demonstrates how to add a user to a watchlist using the [/v1/watchlists/\<watchlist_id\>/included-users/add](/api#operation/AddIncludedUsers) API. To add multiple users, submit a comma-delimited list of actor IDs to the UserIds parameter.

```bash
curl -X POST <requestURL>/v1/watchlists/<watchlist_id>/included-users/add \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-d '{"userIds": ["<actorID>"]}'
```

In the preceding example:

* Replace `<watchlist_id>` with the watchlist ID obtained from the  [watchlists](api/#operation/ListWatchlists) API.
* Replace `<actorID>` with a list of actor IDs.

### Remove an actor from a watchlist

The following example demonstrates how to remove an actor from a watchlist using the [/v1/watchlists/\<watchlist_id\>/included-users/delete](/api#operation/DeleteIncludedUsers) API. To remove multiple actors, submit a comma-delimited list to the UserIds parameter.

```bash
curl -X POST <requestURL>/v1/watchlists/<watchlist_id>/included-users/delete \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-d '{"userIds": ["<actorID>"]}'
```

In the preceding example:

* Replace `<watchlist_id>` with the watchlist ID obtained from the  [watchlists](api/#operation/ListWatchlists) API.
* Replace `<actorID>` with a list of actor IDs.


### Get a user risk profile

A user's risk profile appears in their watchlist entry, and includes notes about their risk.

The following example demonstrates how to get a risk profile of a user with the [/v1/user-risk-profiles](/api#operation/ListUserRiskProfiles) API.

```bash
curl -X GET <requestURL>/v1/user-risk-profiles/<actorID> \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>"
```

In the preceding example, replace `<actorID>` with the actor's ID.


## Search file events

Use the File Events API to search for file activity, also known as "Forensic Search". 


### Groups and filters

File Events API queries are organized by groups of filters. This structure facilitates complicated requests with multiple `AND` or `OR` conditions. For example, use case 1 in the [Sample use cases](#sample-use-cases) section searches for files matching any one of 11 different file extensions that also exist in any one of nine different locations. Search queries are limited to a total of 1,024 criteria per request.

For example, the JSON below uses two groups of filters:

* The first group uses a `filterClause` value of `OR`, which returns results if any of the four MD5 values are found (`db349b97c37d22f5ea1d1841e3c89eb4` or `84c82835a5d21bbcf75a61706d8ab549` or `f351e1fcca0c4ea05fc44d15a17f8b36` or `7bf2b57f2a205768755c07f238fb32cc`).

* The second group uses a `filterClause` value of `AND`, which returns results only if all criteria in the filter are met (in this example, `on or after 2022-06-01` **and** `on or before 2022-06-16`).

* Finally, to link these two groups together, the `groupClause` value of `AND` returns results only if both the first group and second group criteria are met.

}
```

### Sample request

This simple example demonstrates a search for all files on all devices with the file extension `.docx` that exist anywhere except the file path `C:/Users`. For more complicated examples with multiple groups and additional filters, see the [sample use cases](#sample-use-cases) in the next section.

Use the following as a starting point for your own searches:

```bash
curl -X POST <RequestURL>/v2/file-events \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-d '{
    "groups": [{
        "filters": [{
            "operator": "IS",
            "term": "file.name",
            "value": "*.docx"
        },
        {
            "operator": "IS_NOT",
            "term": "file.directory",
            "value": "C:/Users*"
        }
    ],
    "filterClause": "AND"
    }],
    "groupClause": "AND",
    "pgNum": 1,
    "pgSize": 100
}'
```

**Note:** To receive results in CSV format instead of JSON, use the [/v2/file-events/export](/api#operation/exportUsingPOST_1) resource instead of [/v2/file-events](/api#operation/searchEventsUsingPOST_1).

### API limits

* Request rate: To ensure optimal performance throughout your Code42 environment, Code42 limits API requests to 120 per minute. Requests that exceed this limit are blocked and do not return results.
* Result set:
  * `file-events` results are limited to 10,000 events per request. Requesting a page number that exceeds these limits returns an error (for example, a `file-events` query with `pgSize=10000` cannot display `pgNum=2`). To obtain more than 10,000 results, use the `pgToken` and `nextPgToken` request fields to submit multiple requests. (For `pgToken` implementation details, see the [/v2/file-events](/api#operation/searchEventsUsingPOST_1) API documentation.)
  * `file-events/export` queries are limited to 200,000 events.
  * `file-events/grouping` queries are limited to 1,000 groups

### Sample Use Cases

#### Use case 1: Search for application files in unexpected locations

The sample JSON below shows how to search for files with any of these extensions (.action, .app, .bat, .bin, .cmd, .com, .command, .cpl, .exe, .msc, .osx) that exist outside these locations:

* `C:\Program Files`
* `/Applications`
* `/Library`
* `/User/*/Applications`
* `/User/*/Library`
* `/usr/bin`
* `/usr/local/bin`
* `/sbin`
* `/bin`

##### Sample JSON search query for application files in specific locations

Modify this sample to fit your environment and then include it in a request (as shown in the [Sample request](#sample-request) section above).

#### Use case 2: Search for files on a device within a specific date range based on MD5 values

The sample JSON below shows how to search for files files matching any of four MD5 values that existed on devices between June 1 and 16, 2022.

**Note:** To search for SHA256 hash values instead of MD5, replace `file.hash.md5` with `file.hash.sha256` in the sample JSON below.

#### Use case 3: See all cloud sync destinations for a user

The sample JSON below shows how to use the [/v2/file-events/grouping](/api#operation/groupingUsingPOST_1) resource to find an approximate count of **Synced to cloud service** file events for a specific user for each cloud service. This sample groups by the `destination.name` value, but you can choose any `groupingTerm` listed in the [/v2/file-events/grouping](/api#operation/groupingUsingPOST_1) API documentation in your requests.

##### Sample JSON search query for cloud service file event counts

Modify this sample to fit your environment and then include it in a request (as shown in the [Sample request](#sample-request) section above). For grouping queries, you must use the [/v2/file-events/grouping](/api#operation/groupingUsingPOST_1) resource.

```json
{
  "groupingTerm": "destination.name",
  "groups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "operator": "IS",
          "term": "user.email",
          "value": "jim.harper@example.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Sample results of cloud service file event counts

```json
{
    "groups": [
        {
            "value": "google drive",
            "docCount": 52974
        },
        {
            "value": "dropbox",
            "docCount": 20
        },
        {
            "value": "gmail",
            "docCount": 14
        },
        {
            "value": "uncategorized",
            "docCount": 3
        }
    ],
    "problems": null
}
```

**Missing or unknown values**

Some file events may not capture all metadata. Reasons for omitted metadata can include:

* The file did not exist on disk long enough for Code42 to capture all the metadata.
* Several values, including `user.email` and `user.id`, are captured and reported from the Code42 cloud instead of directly from the user device. If those values haven't been reported yet, they may be blank or may display as `UNKNOWN` or `NAME_NOT_AVAILABLE`.

## Use case: Respond to an alert

This use case shows how to run different APIs in sequence to respond to a high-value alert:

1. Search alerts to find one of interest.
2. View the alert's details.
3. Open a case.
4. Add file events from the alert to the case.



### Before you begin

#### Set up monitoring and alerts

Before you can receive alerts about users' file activity, do the following:

* [Enable endpoint monitoring](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827636319767).
* [Create rules to alert you when suspicious file activity occurs](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827739445271).
* (Optional) Set up additional monitoring to capture file activity.
See the following articles:
    * [Detect and respond to insider threats](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827657334807#part-1-capture-file-activity-0-3)
    * [Trusted activity reference](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827632437655-Trusted-activity)
    * [Introduction to adding data connections](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827711938199)

#### Plan your work

Before you start writing scripts to handle alerts using the Code42 APIs, consider the following:

**Why do you want to automate responding to alerts?**

Using APIs to automatically respond to alerts provides economies of scale. If you monitor insider risk at a small company, you could [use the the Code42 console](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687892375) to receive notifications about suspicious file activity. But for larger companies with many more employees to track, automating the process with the Code42 APIs provides a faster and more efficient method. As an added benefit, you can [integrate the Code42 APIs](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687363351) with other systems such as your company's security tools. Planning and implementing Code42 APIs can take some time. Before you begin using Code42 APIs to manage alerts, consider the effort involved to set them up against the time savings provided when they run.

**What are the kinds of alerts you want to receive?**

You want to receive alerts when users perform actions that are considered high risk. Determine the kinds of actions that you want to receive alerts about and then [create alerts](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827739445271) that will be triggered by those actions. Creating the right kinds of alerts provides the best monitoring possible of high risk file activity.

#### Gather your inputs

Before attempting to write scripts using the Code42 API examples in this article, gather the following inputs:

- **Authentication token**

[Authentication tokens](#authentication) are required to run the APIs.

- **Tenant ID**

Your company's entity in the Code42 cloud is known as a "tenant". To obtain your tenant ID, submit a request to the [customer API](/api/#tag/Customer).

- **Code42 usernames for the people you want to add to alert rules**

You need the Code42 usernames of employees to add them to alerts. The Code42 username is assigned when the user is [added to Code42](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827696671127). You can obtain usernames via [CSV export](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827660096407#csv-export-field-definitions-0-6), [user reports](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827682476183#user-backup-report-0-2), or the [Users API](#tag/User).


### Step 1: Search alerts to find one of interest

Alerts are an excellent way to get notifications about suspicious file activity. However, sometimes it can be difficult to separate the truly important ones from the rest.
To find alerts that are worthy of further investigation, use the [/v1/alerts/query-alerts](/api#operation/Alerts_QueryAlert) API command to search for alert notifications by alert filter criteria. By using filters you can uncover only the alerts that you want to follow up on.

```bash
curl -X POST "<RequestURL>/v1/alerts/query-alerts" \
-H "accept: text/plain" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "tenantId": "<SampleTenant>",
  "groups": [
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "term": "<FilterType>",
          "operator": "<OperatorValue>",
          "value": "<Criteria>"
        }
      ],
      "filterClause": "AND"
    }
  ],
  "groupClause": "OR",
  "pgSize": "20",
  "pgNum": "0",
  "srtKey": "CreatedAt",
  "srtDirection": "DESC"
}'
```

In the preceding example, for the [filter syntax](#filter-syntax-for-the-query-alerts-api-command), replace `<FilterType>` with the filter, `<OperatorValue>` with the operator option, and `<Criteria>` with the search term to use in the search.

A successful response returns basic information about the alert notifications that match your search criteria, including the alert IDs of notifications returned by the query (look for the "id" entry):

```json
{
  "type$": "ALERT_SUMMARY",
  "tenantId": "123456",
  "type": "FED_ENDPOINT_EXFILTRATION",
  "name": "Departing employee endpoint exfiltration system rule",
  "description": "System rule for departing employee endpoint exfiltration.",
  "actor": "burt.morales@example.com",
  "target": "N/A",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "ruleId": "123456789424242",
  "ruleSource": "Departing Employee",
  "id": "987654321424242",
  "createdAt": "2020-04-03T15:21:44.6139300Z",
  "state": "OPEN",
  "totalCount": 1,
  "problems": []
}
```

**Note:** You can further filter alerts by adding more [filter types](#filter-syntax-for-the-query-alerts-api-command) to your query. For example, you could use the Severity filter to find only those alerts that were high severity, or the RuleName filter to find only alerts from a particular rule.


### Step 2: View the alert details

After you've located the ID for an alert you want to investigate further, use the [/v1/alerts/query-details](/api#operation/Alerts_QueryAlertDetails) API command to view details about the alert, including the files involved in the file events that triggered the alert.

```bash
curl -X POST "<RequestURL>/v1/alerts/query-details" \
-H "accept: text/plain" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "alertIds": [ "<SampleAlertID>" ]}'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<SampleAlertID>` with the ID of an alert notification listed in the response in [Step 1](#step-1-search-alerts-to-find-one-of-interest) above.

A successful response returns full details about the alert notification, including event IDs (look for "eventid") and a list of files involved in the event (look for "files" followed by "name").

```json
{
  "type$": "ALERT_DETAILS_RESPONSE",
  "alerts": [
    {
      "type$": "ALERT_DETAILS",
      "tenantId": "123456",
      "type": "FED_ENDPOINT_EXFILTRATION",
      "name": "Departing employee endpoint exfiltration system rule",
      "description": "System rule for departing employee endpoint exfiltration.",
      "actor": "burt.morales@example.com",
      "target": "N/A",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "ruleId": "123456789424242",
      "ruleSource": "Departing Employee",
      "id": "987654321424242",
      "createdAt": "2020-04-08T13:50:25.3644410Z",
      "state": "OPEN",
      "observations": [
        {
          "type$": "OBSERVATION",
          "id": "112233445566",
          "observedAt": "2020-04-08T13:40:00.0000000Z",
          "type": "FedEndpointExfiltration",
          "data": "{\"type$\":\"OBSERVED_ENDPOINT_ACTIVITY\",\"id\":\"665544332211\",\"sources\":[\"Endpoint\"],\"exposureTypes\":[\"ApplicationRead\",\"CloudStorage\"],\"firstActivityAt\":\"2020-04-08T13:40:00.0000000Z\",\"lastActivityAt\":\"2020-04-08T13:45:00.0000000Z\",\"fileCount\":2,\"totalFileSize\":311096,\"fileCategories\":[{\"type$\":\"OBSERVED_FILE_CATEGORY\",\"category\":\"Image\",\"fileCount\":2,\"totalFileSize\":311096,\"isSignificant\":false}],\"files\":[{\"type$\":\"OBSERVED_FILE\",\"eventId\":\"998877665544\",\"path\":\"C:/Users/burt.morales/\",\"name\":\"1586353274_family_photo.png\",\"category\":\"Image\"},],\"syncToServices\":[\"Dropbox\"],\"sendingIpAddresses\":[\"192.0.2.0\"]}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Look for the files involved in the alert

Use the [File Events APIs](#tag/File-Events) to look for the files identified in the preceding alert query response.
The following sample request using the [/v2/file-events](/api#operation/searchEventsUsingPOST_1) API command demonstrates a search for all files on all devices with the file extension **.docx** that exist anywhere in the file path **C:/Users**. Use this simple example as a starting point for your own searches and replace the content of the -d section with your specific search criteria.

```bash
curl -X POST <RequestURL>/v2/file-events \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-d '{
    "groups": [{
        "filters": [{
            "operator": "IS",
            "term": "file.name",
            "value": "*.docx"
        },
        {
            "operator": "IS",
            "term": "file.directory",
            "value": "C:/Users*"
        }
    ],
    "filterClause": "AND"
    }],
    "groupClause": "AND",
    "pgNum": 1,
    "pgSize": 100
}'
```

### Step 3: Open a case

To track your investigation of the event that triggered the alert, use the [/v1/cases](/api#operation/createCaseUsingPOST) API command to create a case.
Only the `"name"` parameter is required. To leave a field blank, supply the value `null`.

```bash
curl -X POST <RequestURL>/v1/cases \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>' \
-d '{
  "name": "Sample case name",
  "description": "Sample description",
  "findings": "Sample findings",
  "subject": "<UserUID>",
  "assignee": null
}'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<UserUID>` with the user UID of the person who is being investigated.

Following is an example response showing the case number.

```json
{
  "number": 1,
  "name": "Sample case name",
  "createdAt": "2020-10-27T15:16:05.369203Z",
  "updatedAt": "2020-10-27T15:16:05.369203Z",
  "description": "Sample description",
  "findings": "Sample findings",
  "subject": null,
  "subjectUsername": null,
  "status": "OPEN",
  "assignee": null,
  "assigneeUsername": null,
  "createdByUserUid": "806154242834341101",
  "createdByUsername": "user@example.com",
  "lastModifiedByUserUid": "806154242834341101",
  "lastModifiedByUsername": "user@example.com"
}
```

### Step 4: Add file events from the alert to the case

To populate the new case with information about the alert, add file events from the alert to the case using the [/v1/cases/\<CaseNumber\>/fileevent](/api#operation/addEventsToCaseUsingPOST) API command.

```bash
curl -X POST '<RequestURL>/v1/cases/<CaseNumber>/fileevent' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>'
-d '{"events": [
  "<EventID>",
  "<EventID>",
  ...
]}'
```

In the preceding example:

* Replace `<CaseNumber>` with the case number shown in the response in [Step 3](#step-3-open-a-case) above.
* Replace `<EventID>` values with the event IDs shown in the response in [Step 2](#step-2-view-the-alert-details) above.


## Use case: Track file activity of a high risk employee

This use case shows how to run different APIs in sequence to manage a high risk employee from the time they are identified to when you no longer need to monitor their file activity:

1. Add the user to a watchlist.
2. Add the user to an alert rule.
3. Search for alerts the user triggered.
4. Remove the user from the watchlist when tracking is no longer desired.


### Before you begin

#### Plan your work

Before you start writing scripts using the Code42 APIs, consider the following questions to help you plan your work:

**Why do you want to automate adding users to watchlists?**

Adding users to watchlists automatically provides economies of scale. If you monitor insider risk at a small company, you could use the [watchlists in the Code42 console](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687477143) to track file activity for high risk employees. But for larger companies with many more employees to track, automating the process with the Code42 API provides a much faster and efficient method. As an added benefit, you can [integrate the Code42 APIs](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827687363351) with other systems such as your company's security tools. Planning and implementing Code42 APIs can take some time. Before you begin using Code42 APIs to manage high risk employees, consider the effort involved to set them up against the time savings provided when they run.

**What are the kinds of alerts you want to receive?**

The primary reason to add users to watchlists is to receive alerts when those users perform actions that are considered high risk. Before you start adding users, determine the kinds of actions that you want to receive alerts about and then [create alerts](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827739445271) that will be triggered by those actions. Creating the right kinds of alerts provides the best monitoring possible of your the file activity of high risk employees.

**What other systems with data about risk factors should you consider?**

When determining risk factors to assign to employees, consider where else to look for supporting evidence, such as HR systems, security scanning tools, access management applications, Internet access monitoring tools, and so on. These can all provide additional information that you can place in the notes for the high risk employees, which will help guide any investigations that might be opened on these users.

#### Gather your inputs

Before attempting to write scripts using the Code42 API examples in this article, gather the following inputs:

* **Authentication token**

[Authentication tokens](#authentication) are required to run the APIs.

* **Tenant ID**

Your company's entity in the Code42 cloud is known as a "tenant". To obtain your tenant ID, use your Code42 administrator credentials to submit a request to the [customer API](/api/#tag/Customer).

* **Code42 usernames for the people you want to add to the watchlists**

You need the Code42 usernames of employees to add them to watchlists. The Code42 username is assigned when the user is [added to Code42](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827696671127#add-users-manually-0-2). You can obtain usernames via [CSV export](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827660096407#csv-export-field-definitions-0-6), [user reports](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827682476183#user-backup-report-0-2), or the [Users API](#tag/User).


### Step 1: Add the user to a watchlist

To add the user to a watchlist, use the [/v1/watchlists/\<watchlist_id\>/included-users/add](/api#operation/AddIncludedUsers) API command.

```bash
curl -X POST <requestURL>/v1/watchlists/<watchlist_id>/included-users/add \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-d '{"userIds": ["<userUIDs>"]}'
```

In the preceding example:

* Replace `<watchlist_id>` with the watchlist ID obtained from the [/v1/watchlists](/api#operation/ListWatchlists) API command.
* Replace `<userUIDs>` with the user's userUID in Code42.



### Step 2: Add the user to an alert rule

Do the following to add the user to alerts using the APIs.

#### Add the user to default watchlist rules

When the user is added to a watchlist they are automatically added to the the watchlist's default alert rules. There is no need to use the API to add the user to, or remove a user from, the default alert rules.

To receive alerts from the watchlist, enable the watchlist's alert rules using the [POST /v2/alert-rules/enable](/api/#tag/Rules/operation/Rules_Enable2) API command.

#### Add the user to other alert rules

You can use the API to add the user to other existing [alert rules](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827730038935-Manage-Rules-reference) that monitor user file activity.


### Step 3: Search for alerts the user triggered

To find alerts triggered by the user, search for alerts with the Actor filter using the [/v1/alerts/query-alerts](/api#operation/Alerts_QueryAlert) API command as shown in the following example:

```bash
curl -X POST <RequestURL>/v1/alerts/query-alerts \
-H "accept: text/plain" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "tenantId": "<SampleTenant>",
    "groups": [
        {
            "filters": [
                {
                    "term": "Actor",
                    "operator": "Is",
                    "value": "<ActorUsername>"
                }
            ],
            "filterClause": "AND"
        }
    ],
    "groupClause": "OR",
    "pgSize": "20",
    "pgNum": "0",
    "srtKey": "CreatedAt",
    "srtDirection": "DESC"
}'
```

In the preceding example, replace `<ActorUsername>` with the Code42 username of the user.

A successful response returns basic information about the alert notifications that match your search criteria, including the alert IDs of those notifications (look for the `"id":"value"` entry):

```json
{
  "type$": "ALERT_SUMMARY",
  "tenantId": "123456",
  "type": "FED_ENDPOINT_EXFILTRATION",
  "name": "Exposure on an endpoint from High Risk Employees system rule",
  "description": "System rule for exposure on an endpoint from High Risk Employees.",
  "actor": "burt.morales@example.com",
  "target": "N/A",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "ruleId": "123456789424242",
  "ruleSource": "High Risk Employee",
  "id": "987654321424242",
  "createdAt": "2020-04-03T15:21:44.6139300Z",
  "state": "OPEN"
}
```

#### Filter alerts

You can further filter alerts by adding more filter types. For example, you could use the `Severity` filter to find only those alerts that were high severity, or the `RuleName` filter to find only alerts from a particular rule.

#### Search the user's file activity

In addition to using alerts to identify file activity, you can use the [File Events API](/api#tag/File-Events) to search for the user's file activity.



### Step 4: Remove the user from the watchlist when tracking is no longer desired

You can remove the user from the watchlist using the [/v1/watchlists/\<watchlist_id\>/included-users/delete](/api#operation/DeleteIncludedUsers) API.

```bash
curl -X POST <requestURL>/v1/watchlists/<watchlist_id>/included-users/delete \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>" \
-d '{"userIds": ["<userUIDs>"],"watchlistId": "<WatchlistID>"}'
```

In the preceding example:

* Replace `<userUIDs>` with the user's user UID in Code42.
* Replace `<WatchlistID>` with the watchlist ID.


To verify that the user is removed, obtain a listing of all users on the watchlist by running the [/v1/watchlists/\<watchlist_id\>/included-users](/api#operation/ListIncludedUsers) API command.
