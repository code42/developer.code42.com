A case is used to record the results of an investigation into suspicious file activity.

Cases enable you to:

- Assemble evidence related to an investigation
- Add file events from Forensic Search
- Add notes to provide additional context
- Summarize and share findings with others in your organization

Typically, a security analyst will create a case based on an investigation that shows unauthorized file activity, and will add file events from Forensic Search to the case as evidence. The case can have additional file events added to it if needed, and can be routed in a CSV or PDF file as necessary for resolution.
