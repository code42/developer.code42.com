Sessions group all Incydr activity for an individual actor within a specific time frame. Sessions may include file events, alerts, Instructor lessons, and more. A single session can contain one or more alerts.

Alerts are triggered when user file activity matches criteria defined in your alert rules. Alerts are included within sessions to group related activity and provide additional context.
