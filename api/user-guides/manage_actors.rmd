## Manage actors

The Actor APIs are useful to get an actor's basic information. Actors are the identities monitored by Incydr.

### Get an actor

You can get information on an individual actor that includes the name (usually an email address), and attributes about the actor like department and geography.

The following example demonstrates how to get information on a user with the [/v1/actors/actor/name/\<name\>/parent](/api/#tag/Actors/operation/getActorOrParentByName) API.

```bash
curl -X GET <requestURL>/v1/actors/actor/name/<name>/parent \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H "authorization: Bearer <AuthToken>"
```

In the preceding example, replace `<name>` with the with the actorâ€™s full username/email.
